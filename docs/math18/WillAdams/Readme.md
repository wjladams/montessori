# Will Adams' 2017-2018 Math Projects

* [ProjectileSimulation1.py](ProjectileSimulation1.py): A simulation that has the following properties
  * Starts on the surface of the earth
  * Starts with an initial velocity as x and y components,  v<sub>x</sub> and v<sub>y</sub>
  * Uses matplotlib to show the trajectory (but not where Earth is)
  * Best run from either spyder or ipython
* [Simulation2.py](Simulation2.py): A second simulation, with the following properties
  * Starts from "the top of the earth"
  * Uses initial velocity, but with magnitude and angle (in degrees)
  * Graphs trajectory using matplotlib
  * Graphs Earth on it as well
* [Simulation2.ipynb](Simulation2.ipynb): Uses ideas of Simulation2.py, but in Jupyter notebook form
* [Simulation3.py](Simulation3.py): A third iteration of the simulation
  * Uses a class to store the simulation data
  * Can step through a bit of the simulation, and then change acceleration
  * Can change heading
  * More like launching an actual rocket
  * Graphs with matplotlib and shows the earth as well
* [Sim3-Example1.ipynb](Sim3-Example1.ipynb) An example Jupyter notebook using Simulation3.py
* [Sim3.ipynb](Sim3.ipynb) Using Simulation3.py, Will finds a stable orbit.
